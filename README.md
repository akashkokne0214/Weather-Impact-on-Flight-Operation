## 📌 Project Overview
The **Weather Impact on Flight Operations** Dashboard is a Power BI visualization designed to analyze how different weather conditions influence flight performance metrics such as delays, cancellations, and passenger satisfaction.

It provides airlines, airport operators, and analysts with real-time insights into how adverse weather impacts flight operations, helping improve decision-making, scheduling efficiency, and passenger communication.

## 🌦️ Visual Highlights
1. **Flight Delay Over Time by Weather**
A line chart comparing delays over time between weather-impacted and non-weather-impacted flights.
This helps identify seasonal or monthly trends related to adverse weather effects.

2. **Average Flight Satisfaction by Weather Condition**
A bar chart comparing passenger satisfaction levels between flights affected and unaffected by weather.

3. **Cancellations in Bad Weather**
A donut chart representing the proportion of flights cancelled due to weather vs those that operated normally.

4. **No Show Count by Weather & Travel Purpose**
A clustered bar chart displaying how different travel purposes (Business, Family, Leisure, Emergency) are affected by weather-related disruptions.

## 🧭 Filters & Segmentation
Interactive buttons at the top of the dashboard allow users to filter by Travel Class:
- Business
- Economy
- First
- Premium Economy
Each segment dynamically updates visuals to reflect class-specific trends and weather impact on customer experience.

## 🧠 Insights Gained
- Weather disruptions significantly affect on-time performance and passenger reliability.
- Business travelers are more resilient to weather-related no-shows compared to leisure travelers.
- Cancellation rates spike during severe weather months.
- Despite delays, satisfaction levels remain stable when communication and support are proactive.
